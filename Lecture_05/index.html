    <div class="container">
        <!-- Image tag is an inline tag because it comes next to each other -->
        <img src="poster1.webp" alt="poster1" width="300px" height="300px" class="image1">
        <img src="poster2.webp" alt="poster1" width="300px" height="300px" class="image2">
        <!-- Using position relative we set the property of element to left right top and bottom and every element take position according to current window.-->
        <!-- An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (with position other than static).
        However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
        Note: Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal document flow, and can overlap other elements. -->
